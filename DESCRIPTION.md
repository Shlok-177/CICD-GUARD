# cicd-guard - CI/CD Security Scanner

## What is cicd-guard?

`cicd-guard` is a powerful command-line tool that helps developers and DevOps engineers find security problems in their CI/CD pipeline files before they become real security risks. **Now with a custom rules engine and context-aware secret detection!**

## What does it do?

Think of it as a security guard for your CI/CD pipelines. It automatically scans your pipeline configuration files and looks for common security mistakes like:

* **Hardcoded secrets** - When someone accidentally puts passwords, API keys, or tokens directly in the code
* **Unpinned versions** - When GitHub Actions use `@main` instead of a specific version (which can be dangerous)
* **Exposed secrets** - When pipeline scripts might accidentally show sensitive information
* **üöÄ NEW: Context-Aware Secret Detection** - Smarter detection that reduces false positives by analyzing surrounding context
* **üöÄ NEW: Custom security rules** - Define your own security checks that matter to your organization

## Why do you need it?

CI/CD pipelines often handle sensitive information like:

* Database passwords
* API keys
* Access tokens
* Deployment credentials
* Custom business secrets

If these get exposed, hackers could access your systems, databases, or cloud resources. `cicd-guard` catches these problems early, before they reach production.

## üöÄ NEW: Context-Aware Secret Detection

### What's New in v1.0.1

The latest release introduces **Context-Aware Secret Detection**, which:

* Looks at **how secrets are used**, not just patterns
* Reduces **false positives** by checking surrounding code context
* Detects **misused environment variables** like `echo $SECRET_KEY`
* Adds a `--secrets-only` flag to focus only on secret-related issues

### Example

```bash
./cicd-guard scan --secrets-only
```

## üöÄ Custom Rules Engine

### What's New in v1.0.0

The **Custom Rules Engine** lets you:

* **Create your own security rules** using simple regex patterns
* **Customize severity levels** (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) for your organization
* **Add organization-specific checks** that built-in rules don't cover
* **Override built-in rules** when your custom rules are more relevant
* **Share rule sets** across teams and projects

### Example Custom Rules

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CUSTOM_API_KEY
    pattern: "(SECRET_KEY|API_TOKEN)=[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}"
    severity: HIGH
    message: "Hardcoded API key detected"
    description: "Detects hardcoded API keys in various formats"
```

## How does it work?

1. **Point it at your project** - Tell it where to look.
2. **Choose your scan mode** -

   * **Interactive (default)**: If no flags are provided, `cicd-guard` will list all detected pipeline files and let you choose which ones to scan.
   * **Scan All**: Use the `--all` flag to automatically scan every detected pipeline file without prompts.
   * **Exclude Files**: Use the `--exclude` flag to skip specific files by their index in the list or by their filename.
3. **Load custom rules** - Use `--rules your-rules.yml` for custom checks.
4. **Use context-aware detection** - Enable secret-focused scanning with `--secrets-only`.
5. **It scans automatically** - Checks all your selected CI/CD files with both built-in and custom rules.
6. **Get a clear report** - See exactly what's wrong and where.
7. **Fix the issues** - Address security problems before they become threats.

## What files does it check?

* GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
* GitLab CI configuration (`gitlab-ci.yml`)
* Jenkins pipelines (`Jenkinsfile`)
* Azure DevOps pipelines (`azure-pipelines.yml`)
* **Any file you specify** with custom rules

## Example output

```
üö® Found 4 security issues:
[HIGH] Hardcoded API key detected found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml (line 27)
Context: echo "SECRET_KEY=sk_test_1234567890abcdef"
[HIGH] Hardcoded API key detected found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml (line 28)
Context: echo "API_TOKEN=ghp_abcdef1234567890"
[HIGH] Hardcoded secret detected found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml (line 29)
Context: Deploying with token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
[MEDIUM] Unpinned action detected - consider using a specific version or SHA
Context: Action: actions/checkout@main
```

## Who should use it?

* **Developers** - Check your own projects before pushing
* **DevOps Engineers** - Audit team pipelines for security
* **Security Teams** - Automated security scanning with custom rules
* **CI/CD Pipeline Reviewers** - Quick security assessment
* **Organizations** - Create standardized security rule sets

## Key benefits

‚úÖ **Easy to use** - Simple commands, clear output
‚úÖ **Fast scanning** - Checks entire projects in seconds
‚úÖ **Comprehensive** - Covers multiple CI/CD platforms
‚úÖ **Actionable** - Shows exactly what to fix and where
‚úÖ **Flexible** - JSON output for automation, severity filtering
‚úÖ **üöÄ NEW: Context-Aware Detection** - Smarter secret scanning
‚úÖ **üöÄ NEW: Customizable** - Define your own security rules
‚úÖ **üöÄ NEW: Extensible** - Easy to add organization-specific checks

## Simple usage

```bash
# Interactive scan (lists files and prompts for selection)
./cicd-guard scan

# Scan all detected pipeline files automatically
./cicd-guard scan --all

# Scan a specific directory
./cicd-guard scan --path .github/workflows

# Exclude files by index (e.g., exclude the 2nd and 4th detected files)
./cicd-guard scan --exclude 2,4

# Exclude files by filename (e.g., exclude 'azure-ci/deploy.yaml')
./cicd-guard scan --exclude azure-ci/deploy.yaml

# Use custom rules
./cicd-guard scan --rules my-security-rules.yml

# Get JSON output for automation
./cicd-guard scan --json

# Only show high-severity issues
./cicd-guard scan --severity HIGH

# Scan only for secrets with context-aware detection
./cicd-guard scan --secrets-only

# Combine options (e.g., scan all files in a directory, exclude one, and output JSON)
./cicd-guard scan --path . --all --exclude custom/ci-pipeline.yaml --json
```

## Think of it as...

A security scanner that automatically reviews your CI/CD setup and says "Hey, I found some security problems you should fix!" - like having a security expert review your pipelines, but automated, always available, and **now smarter with context-aware detection**.

## üìù What's New

### v1.0.1

* **Context-Aware Secret Detection**: Smarter secret scanning with reduced false positives
* **New flag `--secrets-only`**: Scan only for secret-related issues
